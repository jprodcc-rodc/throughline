**v0.2.0 alpha** — running 24/7 in production. [Issues welcome](https://github.com/jprodcc-rodc/throughline/issues).
Docs: <https://jprodcc-rodc.github.io/throughline/>

## ✨ What it does

**Before throughline:** Every new chat starts from zero. Your AI
forgets your medical history, your project, your preferences, the
conclusions you reached last month. You re-explain yourself every
time. Past conversations pile up somewhere you never look again.

**After throughline:** Every conversation gets refined into a durable
six-section Markdown card in your Obsidian vault. The next chat that
overlaps automatically pulls the card back in. Your AI already knows
you.

- **Cards are plain Markdown** — grep them, edit them, read them in
  five years no matter what tool you use then.
- **Taxonomy grows as you write** — 5 broad domains seed; system
  observes drift, proposes new ones for your approval.
- **Zero lock-in** — 16 OpenAI-compatible LLM providers, 5 swappable
  vector stores, 5 swappable rerankers.

---

## 💡 Why this exists

Most personal-knowledge tools either:
- **Record** but don't **synthesize** (raw transcripts pile up)
- **Synthesize** but lose **personal context** (generic answers about
  your own meds / projects / history)
- **Inject personal context** but leak it into the **public index**
  (your RAG now has your address in it)

throughline separates *mechanism* (system provides) from *content*
(you provide) at every layer, so you can safely share the engine
without sharing yourself.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Docker compose (evaluate in 5 minutes, no Python install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jprodcc-rodc/throughline.git
cd throughline
cp .env.example.compose .env          # set ONE provider API key
docker compose up -d
docker compose run --rm daemon \
    python -m throughline_cli import sample   # 10 sample conversations
docker compose logs -f daemon
```

Default `EMBEDDER=openai` + `RERANKER=skip` keeps the image to
~400 MB. Add `--build-arg INSTALL_LOCAL=1` for the full local
(`bge-m3` + reranker) path. Full walkthrough in
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` § Docker compose](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#docker-compose-try-it-in-5-minutes).

### Install wizard (16 steps, all-Enter defaults — or 1-command express)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jprodcc-rodc/throughline.git
cd throughline
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python install.py --express                          # ← already exported an API key? skip the 16-step interview
# OR
python install.py                                    # ← the full 16-step wizard
```

`--express` auto-detects whichever LLM provider env var you have
exported (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
…), fills sane defaults for everything else, prints the
per-conversation cost + daily cap, and writes config in ~3 seconds.
Run `--express --dry-run` to preview without committing.

What the full wizard covers, in order: Python check → mission (Full /
RAG-only / Notes-only) → vector DB → LLM provider → privacy level →
embedder + reranker → prompt family → import source + path → import
scan + cost estimate + **explicit privacy consent** → refine tier
(Skim / Normal / Deep) → card structure → live-LLM preview of your
first card with optional 5-dial tuning → taxonomy strategy → daily
USD cap → summary + run import.

After the wizard:

```bash
python rag_server/rag_server.py        # FastAPI on :8000 — embed + rerank + retrieval
python daemon/refine_daemon.py         # watchdog → refine → vault writer
```

Drop `filter/openwebui_filter.py` into OpenWebUI's Admin → Functions
panel; set its `RAG_SERVER_URL` valve to your local server. Now your
chats refine into cards, the cards get indexed, and the next chat
that overlaps gets the relevant cards injected.

### Re-run, health-check, sample

```bash
python install.py --reconfigure              # change a few settings
python -m throughline_cli doctor              # 13 checks with remediation
python -m throughline_cli import sample       # 10 synthetic conversations
python -m throughline_cli taxonomy review     # approve self-growth signals
python -m throughline_cli refine --dry-run <raw.md>   # preview refiner prompt, no LLM call
python -m throughline_cli stats               # screenshot-friendly summary
python -m throughline_cli cost                # LLM spend dashboard
python -m throughline_cli config validate     # lint config.toml for typos / enum drift
```

> **Obsidian is optional.** The daemon writes plain Markdown +
> frontmatter; any editor reads it. Obsidian is recommended for the
> graph + linking UI, but nothing downstream requires it.

### Manual install (no wizard)

If the wizard is too opinionated for your setup, the long-form guide
in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) walks the same flow by
hand: configure `.env`, start Qdrant via Docker, launch the RAG
server + daemon, install the Filter.

### Pluggable backends

| Component | Default | Alternates (today) | Coming in v0.3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Embedder (`EMBEDDER`) | `bge-m3` (local) | `openai` | `nomic` / `minilm` natively |
| Reranker (`RERANKER`) | `bge-reranker-v2-m3` (local) | `cohere`, `voyage`, `jina`, `skip` (all real impls) | — |
| Vector store (`VECTOR_STORE`) | `qdrant` | `chroma`, `lancedb`, `sqlite_vec`, `duckdb_vss` (embedded, zero-server), `pgvector` (Postgres) — all real impls | — |

### LLM providers

**16 preset routes** — wizard auto-detects whichever env var you've
exported. Direct (OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / xAI), hosted
open-weights (Together / Fireworks / Groq), 5 China-market routes,
OpenRouter proxy, Ollama / LM Studio for fully local, plus a
generic OpenAI-compatible escape hatch.

<details>
<summary><b>Click for the full provider grid + env vars</b></summary>

| Region | Providers |
|---|---|
| **Direct (anywhere)** | OpenAI · Anthropic · DeepSeek · xAI |
| **Hosted open-weights** | Together.ai · Fireworks.ai · Groq |
| **China (大陆 access)** | SiliconFlow (硅基流动) · Moonshot (Kimi) · DashScope (Alibaba Qwen) · Zhipu (智谱 GLM) · Doubao (字节豆包) |
| **Multi-vendor proxy** | OpenRouter (one key → 300+ models) |
| **Local / self-hosted** | Ollama · LM Studio |
| **Escape hatch** | Generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`THROUGHLINE_LLM_URL` + `THROUGHLINE_LLM_API_KEY`) |

Each provider reads its own env var (`OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY`, …). Existing users with
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` already set keep working with zero config
change.

</details>

**Smoke-test the install** (after step 16): ask something in
OpenWebUI that overlaps your existing notes. You should see
`⚡ anchor pass` or `auto recall: mode=general · conf=0.82 · N cards`
above the reply.

## 🃏 What a refined card looks like

You ask in chat six months ago: *"I lost 12kg on strict keto but my
weight's creeping back even at <30g carbs/day. What's going on?"*

Six months later you hit it again. Without throughline, the AI starts
from scratch. With throughline, the daemon already refined that
conversation into a card — `Keto rebound after 6 months — three
mechanisms, not willpower` — and the next chat pulls it back in.

# Scene & Pain Point
After ~6 months of strict keto (<30g carbs/day) with 12kg lost, weight
is creeping back despite holding the same macro rules. Easy to read as
willpower failure; usually not.

# Core Knowledge & First Principles
Three compounding mechanisms, in order of likely magnitude:
1. Adaptive thermogenesis — BMR drops 10-15% during weight loss.
2. Calorie creep — fat-fueled meals are calorie-dense; satiety adapts.
3. Insulin-sensitivity recovery — small glucose loads stored more efficiently.

# Detailed Execution Plan
- Track 7 days of intake honestly vs TDEE minus 15% adaptation deficit.
- Re-introduce measured portions; eyeballing stops working at 4-6 months.
- If the gap is real, the intervention is calories, not carbs.

# Pitfalls & Boundaries
- "Still under 30g carbs" ≠ "still hypocaloric". Protocol-adherence
  doesn't equal caloric deficit.

# Insights & Mental Models
6-month rebound is a data story, not a discipline story. Recovering
biology doing exactly what it's designed to do.

# Length Summary
Keto rebound at month 6 = adaptive thermogenesis + portion drift +
insulin recovery. Fix is a measurement week, not more willpower.

This is the file you grep with `ripgrep`, embed for RAG, and re-read
in five years. The conversation it came from is one line in a daemon log.

## How is this different from `mem0` / `Letta` / `SuperMemory` / OpenWebUI built-in memory?

Short answer: **throughline produces durable, human-readable Markdown
that lives in your file system.** The others produce vectors that live
in their service. Different point on the privacy / portability axis.

| | throughline | mem0 | Letta | SuperMemory | OpenWebUI memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Markdown you can read** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Works fully local** | ✅ | partial | partial | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Self-growing taxonomy** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Survives tool changes** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Target user** | Vault owners | App devs | Agent builders | Consumers | Casual users |

throughline is heavier to install (it's a daemon + RAG server + Filter,
not a SaaS subscription) but the cards persist across tool changes and
you can grep them with `rg` like any other text.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Two independent pipelines, one shared substrate.** They meet only
on append-only storage (Markdown vault + vector store).

### Pipeline 1 — per-turn, in-band (every chat message)

```text
   ┌──────────────┐    query    ┌──────────────┐   vec    ┌──────────┐
   │  OpenWebUI   │ ───────────► │  RAG server  │ ───────► │  Vector  │
   │   Filter     │              │ embed+rerank │ ◄─────── │  store   │
   │  (3-tier     │ ◄─────────── │              │   cards  └──────────┘
   │   gate)      │   context    └──────────────┘
   └──────┬───────┘
          │
          │ injected system prompt
          ▼
   ┌──────────────┐  reply +
   │     LLM      │  status     ┌──────────────┐
   │              │ ──────────► │   You see    │
   └──────────────┘  badge      └──────────────┘
```

Reads from the vector store. **Never writes to the vault.**

### Pipeline 2 — per-conversation, out-of-band (after each chat)

```text
                                        ┌────────────────────┐
                                        │  Markdown vault    │
                                ┌─────► │  (formal card)     │
                                │       └────────────────────┘
   ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐ │       ┌────────────────────┐
   │  raw     │ ── │  Refine  │ ├─────► │  Buffer stub       │
   │  .md     │ ──►│  daemon  │ │       │  (00_Buffer/, needs│
   │ (export) │    │          │ │       │   human triage)    │
   └──────────┘    └──────────┘ │       └────────────────────┘
                                │       ┌────────────────────┐
                                └─────► │  Vector store      │
                                        │  (embeddings)      │
                                        └────────────────────┘
```

Writes to the vault + buffer + vector store. **Never reads live chat.**

Filter bugs **cannot corrupt the vault**. Daemon bugs **cannot
pollute a live reply**. Full breakdown:
